##Development Rules##

If you would like to work on this with me you are very welcome.  However please create a branch with your own username and the push back to that branch.  

Then when you have finished your feature or unit of coding make a pull request to the master branch.  I will then deal with diff conflicts and keep the project tidy.  If you are not sure on how to do this then please let me know.

//PS.  remember to fetch from upstream to your branch regularly to help avoid conflicts!//
